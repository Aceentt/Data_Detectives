Data_Detectives Hackathon

Project Overview
This project was created for the Data_Detectives Hackathon. Our goal is to develop a form that allows users to input a site URL, which is then ingested and added to the HPC-ED (High-Performance Computing and Engineering Data) database. The form validates the input and processes the site data for storage and further analysis.

Team Members:
Code Lead: Dickson Acheampong
Presentation Lead: Jean Anoh
Poster Lead: Paris Coleman
GitHub Lead: Jace Lespinasse

Project Goals:
Form Creation: Develop a user-friendly form for URL input.
Data Ingestion: Implement functionality to ingest and process the site data.
Validation: Ensure the input URL is valid and accessible.
Database Integration: Store the processed data in the HPC-ED database.
Analysis: Enable further analysis of the data.

Features:
User-Friendly Form: A simple and intuitive form for users to input site URLs.
URL Validation: Ensures that only valid and accessible URLs are accepted.
Data Processing: Automated data extraction and processing from the provided URLs.
Database Integration: Efficient storage of processed data in the HPC-ED database.
Logging: Detailed logging of the ingestion process for monitoring and debugging.

Requirements:
Python 3.8 or higher
Flask (for web form)
Requests (for fetching site data)
SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
